Zhou, X., Wang, Z. J., Camps, J., Tomek, J., Santiago, A., Quintanas, A., ... & Rodriguez, B. (2024). Clinical phenotypes in acute and chronic infarction explained through human ventricular electromechanical modelling and simulations. eLife, 13. https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.93002.1

Cellular model is based on https://github.com/jtmff/torord with modifications for modelling post-myocardial infarction border zone and remote zone remodelling. 

Alya input files for running the simulations can be found at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13993395 and the Alya binary executables can be made available upon request. Post-processing scripts in this repository are designed to produce the figures shown in the published article.
